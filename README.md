**based on:**

We pre-trained a StarDist 3D model using the annotation of a *Arabidopsis thaliana* lateral root nuclei dataset provided in (Wolny et al., 2020) and https://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet.

**tested with:**

*Arabidopsis flowers*

H2B:mRuby2 was used for the visualization of somatic nuclei of *Arabidopsis thaliana* flower. The flower was scanned from eight views differing by 45Â° increments in a Zeiss Z1 light-sheet microscope (Valuchova et al., 2020). We used a single view to mimic a challenging 3D segmentation problem. Image files are available in the Image Data Resource (Williams et al., 2017) under the accession code: idr0077.

Volume segmentation. In all images, segmented nuclei are assigned a unique random color.   Side-by-side comparison of segmented somatic nuclei of *Arabidopsis thaliana* flowers obtained with the 3D_Iso_Basic model that was trained on a similar dataset. The red box marks the area that is shown enlarged in the right panel. The green line indicates the location of the yz-plane shown in below.
